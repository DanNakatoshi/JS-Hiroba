## eval() is evil?
I used eval() to execute the user input code on the browser. It is the only way to achieve the TRUE **interactive** console on the web page.
I agree that using eval can cause harm and become vulnerableto the attack.
However in this repository, I only use eval() to excecute the code on the brower and, backend-api allows READ only calls to protect the databse.
